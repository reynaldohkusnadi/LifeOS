# 💼 McKinsey-Style Consultant Framework

## Quick Reference Summary
**Three elite consulting frameworks for AI-powered strategic analysis:** (1) Full industry analysis with SWOT/Porter's Five Forces, (2) Competitive deep dive with market gap identification, (3) CEO-level advisory with trend analysis and GTM plays. Transforms AI into a $300K strategy consultant.

## Purpose
Transform any AI assistant into a world-class strategy consultant trained by McKinsey, BCG, and Bain.
