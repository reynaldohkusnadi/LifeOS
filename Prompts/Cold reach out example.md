# ✍️ Cold Reach out Example

## Purpose
an example of a cold reach out with a good structure that sells a SaaS application for a specific niche. Can be used to feed into an AI as an example output of what im looking for.


## The Prompt

```
Hope you're well. I came across your business recently and wanted to reach out to understand your plans for 2026.

Many teams we speak with still manage production, costings, and inventory primarily in spreadsheets. It works in the early stages, but becomes increasingly time-consuming and error-prone as the business grows.

Zedonk centralises sampling, costings, production, inventory, and wholesale/DTC operations in one place. We support over 1,000 brands globally and integrate with major 3PLs and ecommerce platforms, including Shopify.

I’ve attached some information about the software for you to review. To be transparent, you can absolutely use an off-the-shelf system for around $200 per month but most brands move to Zedonk when they need a scalable, fashion-specific platform that provides structure without limiting growth.

Our key USP is that Zedonk is fully modular, so you can add functionality as you scale rather than overpaying on day one. We also include award-winning client success, weeks of free onboarding training, and ongoing customer support at no additional cost.

Would you be open to an online meeting next week via
